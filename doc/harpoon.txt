2. ⇁ The Problems                                 *harpoon-⇁-the-problems*

1. You’re working on a codebase. medium, large, tiny, whatever. You find
yourself frequenting a small set of files and you are tired of using a fuzzy finder,
`:bnext` & `:bprev` are getting too repetitive, alternate file doesn’t quite cut it, etc etc.
2. You want to execute some project specific commands, have any number of
persistent terminals that can be easily navigated to, send commands to other
tmux windows, or dream up your own custom action and execute with a single key


==============================================================================
3. ⇁ The Solutions                               *harpoon-⇁-the-solutions*

1. Specify either by altering a ui or by adding via hot key files
2. Unlimited lists and items within the lists


==============================================================================
4. ⇁ Installation                                 *harpoon-⇁-installation*

- neovim 0.8.0+ required
- install using your favorite plugin manager (i am using `packer` in this case)

>lua
    use "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" -- don't forget to add this one if you don't have it yet!
    use {
        "ThePrimeagen/harpoon",
        branch = "harpoon2",
        requires = { {"nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"} }
    }

5. ⇁ Getting Started                           *harpoon-⇁-getting-started*


QUICK NOTE                            *harpoon-⇁-getting-started-quick-note*

You will want to add your style of remaps and such to your neovim dotfiles with
the shortcuts you like. My shortcuts are for me. Me alone. Which also means
they are designed with dvorak in mind (My layout btw, I use dvorak btw).


HARPOON:SETUP() IS REQUIRED*harpoon-⇁-getting-started-harpoon:setup()-is-required*

it is a requirement to call `harpoon:setup()`. This is required due to autocmds
setup.


BASIC SETUP                          *harpoon-⇁-getting-started-basic-setup*

Here is my basic setup

>lua
    local harpoon = require("harpoon")
    
    -- REQUIRED
    harpoon:setup()
    -- REQUIRED
    
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>a", function() harpoon:list():append() end)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-e>", function() harpoon.ui:toggle_quick_menu(harpoon:list()) end)
    
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-h>", function() harpoon:list():select(1) end)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-t>", function() harpoon:list():select(2) end)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-n>", function() harpoon:list():select(3) end)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-s>", function() harpoon:list():select(4) end)
<


==============================================================================
6. ⇁ API                                                   *harpoon-⇁-api*

You can define custom behavior of a harpoon list by providing your own calls.

Here is a simple example where i create a list named `cmd` that takes the
current line in the editor and adds it to harpoon menu. When `list:select(...)`
is called, we take the contents of the line and execute it as a vim command

I don’t think this is a great use of harpoon, but its meant to show how to
add your own custom lists. You could imagine that a terminal list would be just
as easy to create.

>lua
    local harpoon = require("harpoon")
    
    harpoon:setup({
        -- Setting up custom behavior for a list named "cmd"
        "cmd" = {
    
            -- When you call list:append() this function is called and the return
            -- value will be put in the list at the end.
            --
            -- which means same behavior for prepend except where in the list the
            -- return value is added
            --
            -- @param possible_value string only passed in when you alter the ui manual
            add = function(possible_value)
                -- get the current line idx
                local idx = vim.fn.line(".")
    
                -- read the current line
                local cmd = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(0, idx - 1, idx, false)[1]
                if cmd == nil then
                    return nil
                end
    
                return {
                    value = cmd,
                    context = { ... any data you want ... },
                }
            end,
    
            --- This function gets invoked with the options being passed in from
            --- list:select(index, <...options...>)
            --- @param list_item {value: any, context: any}
            --- @param list { ... }
            --- @param option any
            select = function(list_item, list, option)
                -- WOAH, IS THIS HTMX LEVEL XSS ATTACK??
                vim.cmd(list_item.value)
            end
    
        }
    })
<


CONFIG                                                *harpoon-⇁-api-config*

There is quite a bit of behavior you can configure via `harpoon:setup()`

- `settings`is the global settings. as of now there isn’t a global setting in use, but once we have some custom behavior i’ll put them here
- `default`the default configuration for any list. it is simply a file harpoon
- `[name] = HarpoonPartialConfigItem`any named lists config. it will be merged with `default` and override any behavior

**HarpoonPartialConfigItem Definition**

>
    ---@class HarpoonPartialConfigItem
    ---@field encode? (fun(list_item: HarpoonListItem): string)
    ---@field decode? (fun(obj: string): any)
    ---@field display? (fun(list_item: HarpoonListItem): string)
    ---@field select? (fun(list_item?: HarpoonListItem, list: HarpoonList, options: any?): nil)
    ---@field equals? (fun(list_line_a: HarpoonListItem, list_line_b: HarpoonListItem): boolean)
    ---@field add? fun(item: any?): HarpoonListItem
    ---@field BufLeave? fun(evt: any, list: HarpoonList): nil
    ---@field VimLeavePre? fun(evt: any, list: HarpoonList): nil
    ---@field get_root_dir? fun(): string
<

**Detailed Definitions** `encode`how to encode the list item to the harpoon
file. if encode is `false`, then the list will not be saved to disk (think
terminals) `decode`how to decode the list `display`how to display the list item
in the ui menu `select`the action taken when selecting a list item. called from
`list:select(idx, options)` `equals`how to compare two list items for equality
`add`called when `list:append()` or `list:prepend()` is called. called with an
item, which will be a string, when adding through the ui menu `BufLeave`this
function is called for every list on BufLeave. if you need custom behavior,
this is the place `VimLeavePre`this function is called for every list on
VimLeavePre. `get_root_dir`used for creating relative paths. defaults to
`vim.loop.cwd()`


SETTINGS                                            *harpoon-⇁-api-settings*

Settings can alter the experience of harpoon

**Definition**

>lua
    ---@class HarpoonSettings
    ---@field save_on_toggle boolean defaults to false
    ---@field sync_on_ui_close boolean defaults to false
    ---@field key (fun(): string)
<

**Descriptions** `save_on_toggle`any time the ui menu is closed then we will
save the state back to the backing list, not to the fs `sync_on_ui_close`any
time the ui menu is closed then the state of the list will be sync’d back to
the fs `key` how the out list key is looked up. This can be useful when using
worktrees and using git remote instead of file path

**Defaults**

>lua
    settings = {
        save_on_toggle = false,
        sync_on_ui_close = false,
        key = function()
            return vim.loop.cwd()
        end,
    },

LOGGER                                                *harpoon-⇁-api-logger*

This can help debug issues on other’s computer. To get your debug log please
do the following.

1. open up a new instance of vim
2. perform exact operation to cause bug
3. execute vim command `:lua require("harpoon").logger:show()` and copy the buffer
4. paste the buffer as part of the bug creation

7. ⇁ Contribution                                 *harpoon-⇁-contribution*

This project is officially open source, not just public source. If you wish to
contribute start with an issue and I am totally willing for PRs, but I will be
very conservative on what I take. I don’t want Harpoon _solving_ specific
issues, I want it to create the proper hooks to solve any problem


==============================================================================
8. ⇁ Social                                             *harpoon-⇁-social*

9. ⇁ Note to legacy Harpoon 1 users*harpoon-⇁-note-to-legacy-harpoon-1-users*

Original Harpoon will remain in a frozen state and i will merge PRs in with _no
code review_ for those that wish to remain on that. Harpoon 2 is significantly
better and allows for MUCH greater control. Please migrate to that (will become
`master` within the next few months).
